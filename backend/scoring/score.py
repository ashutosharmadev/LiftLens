"""Explainable scoring for LiftLens.

V1 scores one number, the shoulder-to-waist ratio (edge to edge, see
docs/adr/004-scale-free-measurements.md), against the user's own first photo:

- ratio_result: the ratio itself, shown from the first photo on.
- progress_result: percent change since the first photo, from the second photo on.
- since_previous_result: percent change since the previous ok check-in.
- flagged_result: a photo that failed the shoulder plausibility check; shown, not scored.

Every result carries its formula, its named inputs and a one-sentence
explanation, so any number shown to a user can be recomputed by hand.
See docs/scoring.md.
