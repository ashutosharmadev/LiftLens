# Measurements API (V1)

## Summary (SOART)

- **Scenario:** the browser measures each photo locally and needs somewhere to save the numbers and get a score back.
- **Obstacle:** the browser runs on a device the user controls, so any request can be edited; the server can't trust the user ID, the time or a claimed ratio. And because photos are discarded, anything not saved at check-in is lost.
- **Action:** the user ID comes only from the verified Cognito token; the server stamps the time and computes the ratio and shoulder check itself; the body accepts exactly six fields with strict limits; raw per-photo values are stored and scores recomputed on every read ([ADR-005](adr/005-store-ingredients-recompute-scores.md)).
- **Result:** one user can never read or write another's history, impossible values never reach the database, and formula improvements apply to the whole history. 63 tests cover every rule below.
- **Troubleshooting:** unknown paths originally returned 405; they now return 404, with 405 kept for wrong methods. Tests that advanced a fake clock got 401 because their tokens had expired; the API was right, and the tests now mint tokens from the fake clock.

The rest of this document is the reference contract.

One Lambda behind a Lambda Function URL, served through CloudFront at `/api/*` on the same domain as the web app. Requests and responses are JSON.

The browser measures the photo and sends **numbers only** ([ADR-002](adr/002-pose-extraction-in-browser.md)). Every request is treated as untrusted: the browser runs on the user's device, and anyone can edit a request in DevTools.

## Authentication

Every request needs `Authorization: Bearer <Cognito ID token>`. The Lambda verifies the token's signature, issuer, audience and expiry, and takes the user's ID from its `sub` claim.

**The user ID never comes from the request body.** If it did, anyone could read or write another user's history by changing one field.

## Data model

DynamoDB table, on-demand billing. One item per measurement.

| Attribute | Type | Key | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `userId` | string | partition key | Cognito `sub` of the owner |
| `timestamp` | string (ISO 8601, UTC) | sort key | When the server saved it |
| `shoulderToWaist` | number | | `shoulderEdgePx ÷ waistEdgePx`, computed by the server |
| `shoulderEdgePx` | number | | Outer shoulder width, edge to edge |
| `waistEdgePx` | number | | Waist width, edge to edge |
| `shoulderJointPx` | number | | Distance between the shoulder joint landmarks |
| `hipJointPx` | number | | Distance between the hip joint landmarks |
| `torsoLengthPx` | number | | Shoulder line to hip line |
| `shoulderCheck` | string | | `ok`, `too_wide` or `too_narrow`, computed by the server |
| `methodVersion` | string | | Which version of the measurement maths produced the numbers |

Not stored: the photo (it never leaves the device), the user's email (Cognito has it), and scores (recomputed on every read, see [ADR-005](adr/005-store-ingredients-recompute-scores.md)).

Pixel values are **never shown** to users: they depend on camera distance ([ADR-004](adr/004-scale-free-measurements.md)). They are stored as ingredients, so ratios and rulers invented later can be computed for old photos too.

**Baseline:** the earliest item with `shoulderCheck = "ok"`, found by reading the user's items in order. A user adds about one item a week, so reading them all stays small.

## `POST /api/measurements`

Saves one measurement and returns it with its score.

**Request body.** Exactly these fields; unknown fields are rejected.

```json
{
  "shoulderEdgePx": 1029,
  "waistEdgePx": 577,
  "shoulderJointPx": 690,
  "hipJointPx": 364,
  "torsoLengthPx": 905,
  "methodVersion": "2026-10-edge-v1"
}
```

**Validation**

| Rule | Error |
|---|---|
| Body larger than 2 KB | 413 |
| Body isn't a JSON object, a field is missing, or an unknown field is present | 400 |
| Any pixel value isn't a finite number between 1 and 10,000 | 400 |
| `methodVersion` isn't a known version | 400 |
| `shoulderEdgePx ÷ waistEdgePx` is outside 0.8–3.0 | 400 |

Error responses name the field: `{"error": "waistEdgePx must be between 1 and 10000"}`.

**Server-side steps**

1. Verify the token; take `userId` from `sub`.
2. Validate the body.
3. Compute `shoulderToWaist` and `shoulderCheck` (outer shoulder ÷ shoulder joints, plausible range 1.1–1.8).
4. Stamp `timestamp` with the server's current UTC time.
5. Save the item.
6. Read the user's items, find the baseline, compute the score.

**Response `201`**

```json
{
  "measurement": {
    "timestamp": "2026-10-10T09:30:00Z",
    "shoulderToWaist": 1.783,
    "shoulderCheck": "ok",
    "methodVersion": "2026-10-edge-v1",
    "isBaseline": false
  },
  "score": {
    "name": "shoulder_to_waist_change_percent",
    "value": 4.88,
    "status": "increased",
    "formula": "(current - baseline) / baseline × 100",
    "inputs": {"current": 1.783, "baseline": 1.7, "noise_threshold": 0.02},
    "explanation": "Your shoulder-to-waist ratio rose 4.9% since your first photo (1.70 → 1.78)."
  }
}
```

Pixel ingredients are stored but not returned.

## `GET /api/measurements`

Returns all of the signed-in user's measurements, oldest first, each with its score recomputed.

**Response `200`**

```json
{
  "baselineTimestamp": "2026-09-01T08:00:00Z",
  "measurements": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2026-09-01T08:00:00Z",
      "shoulderToWaist": 1.7,
      "shoulderCheck": "ok",
      "methodVersion": "2026-10-edge-v1",
      "isBaseline": true,
      "score": {"status": "baseline", "explanation": "Your shoulders are 1.70× as wide as your waist.", "...": "..."}
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2026-09-08T08:00:00Z",
      "shoulderToWaist": 2.1,
      "shoulderCheck": "too_wide",
      "methodVersion": "2026-10-edge-v1",
      "isBaseline": false,
      "score": {"status": "flagged", "explanation": "This photo was flagged (your arms may be in the shoulder outline), so it isn't used for progress.", "...": "..."}
    }
  ]
}
```

`baselineTimestamp` is `null` until there is an `ok` measurement.

## Scores per item

| Item | Score |
|---|---|
| Flagged (`shoulderCheck` isn't `ok`) | Status `flagged`, no percent change; shown greyed out |
| The baseline | `ratio_result`, status `baseline` |
| Any other `ok` item, after the baseline | `progress_result` against the baseline |
| An `ok` item when no baseline exists yet | Can't happen: the first `ok` item is the baseline |

Formulas and wording are in [scoring.md](scoring.md).

## Errors

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| 400 | Invalid body (message names the field) |
| 401 | Missing, invalid or expired token |
| 404 | Any path other than `/api/measurements` |
| 405 | Any method other than `GET` or `POST` |
| 413 | Body larger than 2 KB |
| 500 | Unexpected error (details only in the Lambda's logs) |
